# Basic Todo WebApp!

In an attempt to create some basic projects while I'm bored, this is the old Todo Application everyone makes to start with.

Is it overcomplicated? Yes.
Does it work? On my device, Yes. On others? No Idea.

## Technologies used

- NextJS (No server actions used.)
- TailwindCSS w/ DaisyUI for Styling.
- React (Goes without saying.)
- TypeScript, CSS, HTML.
- FontAwesome for the icons.

## Take-aways

While this is a simple application, I attempted to make it somewhat modular, even though in this use case it hasn't really been of use.
Next JS may have been overkill for the application itself, however I enjoy using the framework for simple applications.
DaisyUI / Tailwind came in clutch as always, I'm not a really creative person so using some pre-built styles and themes is beneficial for me.

## How to run

Clone the repo, install the dependencies (using npm `npm i .`), start the application (using npm `npm run start`).

## Errors?

I'd happily address any errors anyone may find, I'm aware of many vulnerabilities / exploits that could occur as there is no limits set for the application, but these are not of major concern as long as the application is locally hosted.
It was also made for Web, not optimized for mobile although could easily be done so using the affor mentioned libraries.

Again, very simple, done in an hour or two!

## Enjoy!
